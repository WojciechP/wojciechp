# Hello.

## I learn things and build solutions.

Quite regularly I also stumble upon issues I find worth mentioning. So here is
my collection of thoughts: on languages, on software engineering, on making
computers serve humans and not the other way around, on sharing knowledge, on
following the technology trends... Quite a lot of things can happen when working
on software.

I also write on [tech.evojam.com] with other [Evojam] employees.
